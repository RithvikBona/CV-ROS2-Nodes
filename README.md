# Computer Vision ROS2 Nodes
ROS2 nodes for:
 - Synthesizing RGB camera and LIDAR data (Or a PointCloud) to RGBD image
 - Doing YOLO predictions on image data
 - Using YOLO prediction data to assign tracking id's across frames using DeepSORT

These nodes will be used in our Gemstone Team RiDE Robot system.
